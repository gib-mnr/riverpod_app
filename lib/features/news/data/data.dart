String dataLayer = '''

    1. Data Layer
    This layer is responsible for managing the application's data - fetching data
     from external sources (like your APIs), caching data locally, and defining
     models.
     
     Models: You've already defined your NewsArticleModel and Articles models. 
     These are typically part of the data layer since they directly map to the
      data you receive from your APIs.
      
    Data Sources: 
    Define data sources for fetching data from your APIs. 
    You could have RemoteDataSource for network requests
    
        
    
     Repositories: Implement repositories that use your data sources. 
    Repositories are part of the data layer but are used by the domain layer to
     request data. They abstract the origin of the data 
     (remote, cache, etc.). ''';
