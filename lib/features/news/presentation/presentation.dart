   2. Presentation Layer 

   This layer is responsible for everything the user can see and 
   interact with. It includes screens, widgets, and state management.
     
    State Management (Riverpod): 
    Use Riverpod to manage the state of your UI. 
    Define providers for your use cases and consume them in your widgets 
    to display data or execute actions.

    ViewModels/Controllers:
    These classes can be used to interact between your 
    UI (widgets) and the domain layer (use cases). They can hold the
    state of the UI and call use cases to fetch or manipulate data.
    
    
    Widgets: Define Flutter widgets that will use your view models/controllers 
    to display data and interact with the user.
