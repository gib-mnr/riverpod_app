/// To generate the database.g.dart which contains the _$MyDatabase superclass,
/// run dart run build_runner build on the command line.


dart run build_runner build
    -  generates all the required code once.

dart run build_runner watch
 - watches for changes in your sources and generates code with incremental rebuilds. This is suitable for development sessions.

If you've made changes to your tables or database schema, you need to run the build
runner to generate the updated code. Use the following command in your terminal:

///flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
