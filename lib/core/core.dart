String aboutCore = ''' 
    In Clean Architecture, the core directory typically holds shared utilities, 
    base classes, and common functionalities that are not specific to any feature
     but are used throughout the application. On the other hand, the config 
     directory is generally used for configuration-related code such as 
     environment-specific settings, API keys, initialization of core services, 
     etc.
